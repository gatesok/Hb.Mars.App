# Hb.Mars.App

In this project, the user first enters the surface area where the rover can move on Mars. Then it enters the coordinates of the rover and set the necessary commands for movement. There must be a space character between each command for surface and rover coordinates. If the commands are not as desired, an error will be issued.
